                    In nature, no waste does not decompose. Humans, however, have invented plastic which will always be unatural in the environment because of its properties. Making plastic is inexpensive and the applications of the material are endless. Because plastic is so widely used, it almost always ends up in the environment, causing more plastic pollution. And not just because someone leaves a piece of plastic on the street instead of putting it in a waste bin. Of all the plastic we use, 40% is used just once. Every year we use several billion items such as bags, bottles, trays, and food packaging. Supermarkets are full of it. Some people are careless with packaging and leave it behind as litter. But there are also places where people cannot do otherwise because there is no waste collection system. It is without a doubt that even if most people do their best, much of that single-use plastic enters the environment, being one of the biggest cause of plastic pollution. For Example- It is not just about single-use plastic. Often people do not realize that they pollute the environment with plastic. For example, car tires are made of rubber and plastic which wears out while driving. That means that through this friction, thousands of microplastics get released onto the road and in the air. In addition, machine washing and drying of synthetic clothes let loose millions of microfibers into the drainage system. Personal care products and paint can also contain microplastics that wash away in wastewater. In addition, there is a kind of plastic which is also incorporated into cigarette filters and even into chewing gums.
