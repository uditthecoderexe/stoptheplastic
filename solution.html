                   Aside from cleaning up our oceans, which is a very significant first step but not a long-term solution, the best way to address plastic pollution is to change our mindsets and habits with this controversial but very useful material:<br><br>

1.To efficiently reduce plastic pollution, there is an evident need of reducing our usage of plastic. It means changing our everyday behaviors an not using plastic when there is a better alternative to it and only using plastic when strictly necessary.<br><br>

2.Plastic may cause pollution when poorly managed but it has lots of advantages too, such as being resistant. Many plastic items can therefore be reused or used for different purposes. Before throwing plastic items, it is important to consider how they can be reused.<br><br>

3.Plastic recycling consists of collecting plastic waste and reprocessing it into new products, to reduce the amount of plastic in the waste stream.<br><br>

4.Another crucial solution is education to increase awareness and behavioral change.</div></main></body><html>
